This directory encapsulates all the attempts and notes made for approaching the 3-colouring graph problem. In additon to this we have detailed the following:
- The conversion of the problem to an equivalent approach via finding the maximum clique 
- A comprehensive understanding of Grover's search
- Qiskit foundation
- A quantum approach to solve the 3-colouring problem using the Grover's algorithm directly offered by Qiskit
